## Introduction
**FloraFeel** is an innovative project that brings your plants to life by making them interactive and expressive. Using sensors and IoT, the smart pot monitors your plant's health (soil moisture, temperature, light, and humidity) and displays its needs through emojis on an OLED screen. It also sends real-time data to a cloud platform for remote monitoring, ensuring your plant gets the care it deserves.

---

## Features
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Tracks soil moisture, temperature, light intensity, and humidity.
- **Expressive Emojis**: Displays emojis to indicate the plant's condition (e.g., ðŸ˜¢ for thirsty, ðŸ˜Š for happy).
- **Cloud Integration**: Sends data to ThingSpeak for remote monitoring.
- **Web Dashboard**: A simple web page to monitor your plant from anywhere.
- **Alerts**: Notifies you when the plant needs attention (e.g., water or sunlight).

---

## Hardware Requirements
- **Microcontroller**: ESP32
- **Sensors**:
  - Soil Moisture Sensor
  - Temperature and Humidity Sensor (DHT11)
  - Light Intensity Sensor (LDR)
- **Display**: OLED Display (SSD1306)
- **Buzzer**: For alerts
- **Power Supply**: 5V USB or battery
- **Miscellaneous**: Jumper wires, breadboard, resistors, etc.

---

## Software Requirements
- **Arduino IDE**: For programming the ESP32.
- **Libraries**:
  - `DHT` (for temperature and humidity sensor)
  - `Adafruit_SSD1306` (for OLED display)
  - `WiFi` (for ESP32 Wi-Fi connectivity)
  - `ThingSpeak` (for cloud data logging)
- **Web Dashboard**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for monitoring).

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Hardware Setup
- Connect the sensors to the ESP32 as follows:
  - **Soil Moisture Sensor**: Analog pin (e.g., GPIO34)
  - **DHT11**: Digital pin (e.g., GPIO32)
  - **LDR**: Analog pin (e.g., GPIO35)
  - **OLED Display**: I2C pins (SDA: GPIO21, SCL: GPIO22)
  - **Buzzer**: Digital pin (e.g., GPIO25)

### 2. Software Setup
1. **Install Arduino IDE**:
   - Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Open Arduino IDE and install the following libraries via the Library Manager:
     - `DHT`
     - `Adafruit SSD1306`
     - `ThingSpeak`

3. **Upload Code**:
   - Open the `florafeel.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
   - Replace the placeholders in the code with your Wi-Fi credentials and ThingSpeak API key.
   - Upload the code to the ESP32.

4. **Set Up ThingSpeak**:
   - Create a ThingSpeak account and set up a channel with fields for soil moisture, light intensity, temperature, and humidity.
   - Note down the **Channel ID** and **Write API Key**.

5. **Web Dashboard**:
   - Host the `index.html` file on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any other hosting platform.
   - Replace `YOUR_CHANNEL_ID` and `YOUR_READ_API_KEY` in the JavaScript code with your ThingSpeak credentials.
